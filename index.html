The civilization of the Maya is widely recognized as one of the most successful civilizations in history. The reason for the outstanding success of the Maya is because of the integration of their religion into all aspects of life, which led to a very high standard of living, improved political stability, drastically lowered the amount of rebellion, and overall led to the long lasting success of the Maya. Leaders used the Mayan religion to drastically improve many areas of life for their people, as well as to increase and maintain their own power, and to crush rebellion. These are the key reasons that the Mayans were so successful.The Maya were Mesoamericans who first settled around 1500 BCE, in parts of southern Mexico, Guatemala, and northern Belize. The main occupation of the Maya was farming. Their staple crop was corn, although lots of beans and squash were grown as well. The Maya started their rise to power around 250 CE, during the Classic Period (Murphy 21). The civilization itself was comprised of over 40 city-states (Murphy 23). The Mayans had a very specific way of life, in that they strongly integrated their religion with their government (Benson 371). Even things like entertainment, art, and science were determined by an all-encompassing religion (Benson 373). The Mayan religion was greatly dependant on sacrificial ceremonies. Sacrifices were seen as a way of giving life to the forces of the universe, in exchange for the life that those forces had given to them (Alles). In addition, many of their religious offerings were of blood. Blood was collected in many ways, and from many body parts, such as arms, legs, tongues and earlobes (Alles). The Mayans also sacrificed both animals and humans (Alles), during rituals held on certain favorable days (Murphy 39).The Maya had a very high standard of living. The reason for this is because of the way that religion was integrated with everyday life. The Mayan religion improved the life of the Maya by creating more jobs, providing entertainment, and encouraging the creation of art. Because the Mayan religion was so complex, certain people had to be allocated to keep track of what times certain rituals had to take place in order to keep the gods happy. These people were usually priests, or shamans; religious leaders who were believed to have the ability to communicate directly with the gods (Benson 378). The Maya also had a religious ball game, which was used not only as a way of choosing people to be sacrificed, but it also served as a source of entertainment to spectators (Foster). As the ball game was usually played by prisoners or criminals, it was useful for keeping the number of criminals at a manageable level. In addition to decreasing the level of captured criminals, it also reduced the amount of people that became criminals. It did this by using fear to prevent people from turning criminal. Sometimes, the living body of a prisoner or captured enemy would be tightly bound, and used as the game ball itself. At the end of the game, it would be rolled down a steep staircase, a horrific torture if the person somehow managed to live through the game. To a non-criminal spectator, this would allay all thoughts of commiting a crime, in fear that they may be caught and suffer this torturous end (Foster). Mayan religion also encouraged the making of elaborate artwork and sculptures, which were inscribed with hieroglyphics that explained religious beliefs and practices (Stuart 5799). By inscribing religious text onto art and sculptures, the Mayan religion was further enforced onto people.The Mayan religion also served as a source of great entertainment for the Mayan people. The largest source of this entertainment was the Mayanâ€™s religious ball game. The game not only helped to reduce criminal and enemy populations, but it was also open to all Mayans to spectate (Foster). Because the Mayan religion provided free entertainment to them, they were even less likely to rebel against their government, which was hosting the entertainment, and they were also less likely to dispute their religion, which provided them with a source of entertainment. The game itself was played by two teams ranging in size from one to seven players (Bingham). The game was played on a court shaped like the letter â€˜Iâ€™, with two vertical hoops on either end (Benson 383). The goal of the game was for either team to hit a solid hard rubber ball into a hoop, without using hands or feet (Benson 383). These games could last for up to a few days. The Maya thought of the ball game symbolically, as a metaphor for the universe. They believed that the ball represented the Sun, Moon, and Earth. The court was believed to represent the cosmos. The game itself was thought to represent the sacred game of the gods (Bingham). Overall, the Mayan ball game was a major part of upholding religious beliefs and reinforcing religion onto the people. The religion of the Maya also helped to reinforce the stability of the government, reduce rebellion, and increase the power of rulers. The Mayans believed that when someone died, they descended to the underworld, which was comprised of nine different layers (Murphy 37). They also believed that their mortal leaders possessed the ability to descend to these nine layers of the underworld, and communicate with the spirits and the gods, and ask them to bring good fortune to their people (Benson 371). Due to this belief, the Mayan people reinforced their trust with their leaders. Possible rebels would have to think twice before starting an uprising, because the defeat of their leader could lead to misfortune, and they would lose communication with the spirit world. The Maya also did not distinguish between respected religious figures, and people with political power. Powerful kings could give answers to religious questions, and had the final say in how religion was interpreted (Benson 384). Because of this close relation between religion and government, kings used their religious power to reinforce their political power, which, if used sparingly, could prolong their own reign and preserve the life of the Mayan civilization. Another core part of Mayan religion was the belief that time did not progress in a linear fashion. Instead, it was believed that time progressed in a series of loops (Benson 378). At the end of each cycle of the loop, the gods would descend and destroy the earth and extinguish the sun. People depended on their kings to protect them from this fate by using their powers to reason with the gods to postpone the end of the world (Benson 371). Because leaders used religion to increase their power, the Mayan civilization was able to last much longer, and overall be more successful. Like all civilizations, ancient Maya did eventually fall, but not before it had set its place in history as one of the greatest civilizations to ever rule. The decline of the Maya was extremely quick and abrupt, which some experts speculate was due to the combination of both heavy war and the exhaustion of previously fertile soil (Murphy 23). Although Maya was physically destroyed, its legacy is still alive. Even when Spain captured Maya in the 1500s, Mayan religion did not die. Instead, it continued to influence its Roman-Catholic conquerors, and patterns created by the Mayans are still visible today. Â Â ÂOverall, the Maya were a very successful civilization. This is because of the way that their overarching religion was sculpted in a very specific way, to both enforce beliefs onto people, and unite large populations with a common way of life. It was easily changed and enforced by leaders, in the case that they noticed a flaw. Religion also served as a way to entertain Mayans, for example, their religious ball game. In all of their nearly two-thousand-year rule, the Mayan empire has come far closer than any other civilization to discovering the secrets of ruling the perfect empire. By using religion to keep a perfect balance between control and freedom allowed to subjects, Mayan rulers were able to prolong their success and claim their spot in history books for many centuries to follow. â€¨ Works Cited Alles, Gregory D., and Robert S.
